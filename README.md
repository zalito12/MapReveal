# MapReveal

This project is intended to be a tool for DM and d&d players.
Using the power of [KonvaJS](https://konvajs.org/) you will be able to upload your DM maps and add overlays to it so you can reveal part by part on your games while your players explore it.

Also you will be able to create shapes and images between your map and the overlay in order to cover any secret information you need, like traps, secret doors, hidden objects, etc.
